# Fixed Base Configurator

Work in progress, release is pre-alpha and very experimental/unstable.

Provides a Raspberry Pi served web app to ease the pain involved with configuring and maintaining a u-Blox GPS Fixed Base (RTK/RTCM3) installation. Optionally enables a local TCP connection to the GPS module and an NTRIP transport service to stream data to an internet based NTRIP caster.

Uses a Vite managed React framework and ExpressJS backend.

More documentation is forthcoming...
